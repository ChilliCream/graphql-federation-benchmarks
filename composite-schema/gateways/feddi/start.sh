# start.sh — Launch the feddi Gateway and activate the federated schema.
#
# Unlike gateways that embed a pre-composed supergraph, feddi composes at runtime
# from a subgraph-definition ZIP pushed to its admin endpoint. So startup is:
#   1. Launch bin/feddi-gateway (binds :5220 GraphQL, :9091 admin, :9090 health).
#      Before the upload it answers /graphql with HTTP 503 (not initialized).
#   2. POST subgraphs.zip to the admin endpoint; feddi composes the supergraph.
#   3. Verify a real federated query returns data before handing off.
#   4. Stay attached to the gateway process (so the harness can manage its
#      lifecycle and account CPU/RSS against it).
#
# The upload + composition complete within ~1s of the port binding — long before
# the harness's discarded warmup run ends — so all measured runs hit a fully
# composed gateway. If composition fails, the gateway is killed so the harness
# fails loudly instead of benchmarking an uninitialized gateway.
