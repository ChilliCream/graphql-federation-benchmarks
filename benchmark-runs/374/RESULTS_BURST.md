## Overview for: `burst-vus`

Each benchmark runs a GraphQL gateway with 4 subgraphs and executes a heavy nested query that exercises federation/composition capabilities.

Results are split by subgraph technology:
- **Rust Subgraphs** = [async-graphql](https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql) + axum
- **.NET Subgraphs** = [HotChocolate](https://github.com/ChilliCream/graphql-platform)

**Methodology:** Each gateway executes 10 runs of 120s each. The first run is a full-duration warmup (discarded). The remaining 9 runs are measured. Results are ranked by **median RPS** across the 9 measured runs, with best/worst/CV% reported for transparency.

This scenario is a burst stress test with peaks up to **500 VUs** over **120s**.
